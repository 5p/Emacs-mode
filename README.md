## chrome-emacs-mode

Implements a number of Emacs bindings and allows quick navigation through websites without using the mouse. Press the Emacs logo in the toolbar or type CTRL-H, M or ? for help. The plugin is disabled on CTRL-Q.

Notice especially the CTRL-S and CTRL-J features, as these shortcuts enables you to search for links or form controls and thereby navigate very quickly with the keyboard only.

Note: The plugin forces outline on element in focus, and it does not work on some Google sites due to restrictions, including this page and gmail.
